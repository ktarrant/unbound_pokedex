# Unbound Data in JSON Format
The purpose of this repo is to extract and format data collected from
multiple sources into a few consistent JSON files which can be used
for data reference for creating guides.

The C data is taken from here:
TODO: Link GitHub Repo with C data

The Pokemon Location data is from here:
